Procedural Content Generation
==============

This project is to try some PCG. For this project specific I use  
Binary Space Partitioning. 
This project was part of a bigger project. Though only the PCG part was important for me  
so I stripped out files and parts of the bigger project. Some files still have functionality  
for the old project, but this functionality is not being used.

Idea
----------------

I want to create a dungeon or a set of rooms which change in size and numbers.  
I also added in a start location and an end location. I have not added in rooms  
to block the end, which would need some sort of key to unlock a path towards the end.

I am very pleased with the result of my first attempt with PCG, it was a fun and rewarding project.
